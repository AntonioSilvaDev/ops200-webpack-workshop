It this small project, we had to wire up webpack and React.

To get started, open the app in VS code, or code editor of your choosing.  Install the necessary dependencies via the terminal by typing 'npm install'. Next, in the terminal, type 'node .' to start the app on the local node server. Open localhost:3000 in the browser of your choice.
